The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has released **ISO Strategy 2030**, which establishes the organization's vision and mission to make lives easier, safer, and better—supported by a set of actionable goals and priorities. A collaborative effort, members from 165 countries contributed to the development, refinement, and approval of the foundational guiding document. 



**以下为部分内容摘录学习：**

## 3 Our vision for 2030

Making people’s lives easier, safer and better

## 4 Our mission

Through our network of members, we develop International Standards to support global trade,
drive inclusive and equitable economic growth, advance innovation, protect health and improve
safety, and create a sustainable future

## 5 Our goals

Goals are stepping stones to our vision and will help us to ensure that our work makes people’s
lives easier, safer and better. They will help us to maximize our impact and ensure that our
standards support global trade, drive inclusive and equitable economic growth, advance
innovation, protect health and improve safety, and create a sustainable future.

**ISO standards used everywhere**

To realize our vision, our standards have to be widely used. We need to ensure that key players
are aware of the benefits that our standards bring.

**Meeting global needs**

To realize our vision, we must develop consensus-based standards relevant for all countries and
users that respond to current and future challenges. We need to ensure that our standards are
easily accessible, usable, and available when the market needs them.

**All voices heard**

To realize our vision, our system must be inclusive. We need to ensure that we are encouraging
everyone to speak and listening to all voices both in the development of standards and when we
take decisions as an organization.
